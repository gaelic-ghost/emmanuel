#  Progress and Obstacles
And a bit of bitching about the pain that incosiderate engineers cause millions of people, including myself, every day without any accountability.
Migrated from README.md as it's a bit unusual, I suppose. Deal with it or go write something yourself that doesn't physically hurt me to use.

## What is this?
I don't know... It's the result of a human facing overwhelming challenges for decades deciding that separating their work from themselves is best left to those in Serverance. Unfortunately, it seems Severance is actually just a true story about people pulled from SWE roles to act in the series. Maybe that's why they all hate to build accessible products, they can't feel empathy towards those they make suffer. Who knows...

I'd probably describe this as 'Half "keep track of progress and how I'm feeling without having to go organize this all in another application" and half "Outlet for struggles nobody cares about, most of which I was managing better with any stability at all in my life".

People don't tend to complain when systematic disenfranchisement and lack of basic need sbeing met ruin their productivity, lives, and potential. I'm not one to keep quiet, despite my attempts to in order to be given any opportunity to survive. I'm tired of placating others to improve chances that I'm never gonna get to begin with. So fuck this industry, this economy, and this healthcare system. You want a portfolio from the oft-homeless cripple who can outcode you 3x over when they're not sick, starving, and forced off their meds half the time? I'll get you all a fucking portfolio if it's the last thing I do. This serves as a record of my journey through one such new project. A project I'm going solo on, as always, when I more than ever need literally anyone to give a shit. Unfortunately all I get are busy people talking past me and the issues they discourage solutions to. I, unlike this entire industry, am fed up with inaction. From the least able, take the most, give the least, right? Same as always...

Also, no, I don't know what this format is. Maybe it'll become something I use from my IDE as a convenience, maybe I'll map it back to my usual apps, maybe I'll discover I want something new for tracking things in a combined fashion and go build that.

###Day One: 01/15/26

####TODO:

####DONE:
Find some motivation again since reaching out is dumb and doesn't work: done
Contemplate concept just enough to start writing *something*: done
Read too many grabage formatted docs from five hundred sources: done, painfully
Build an initial skeleton: done, sorta
Flesh this out a bit: done, poorly, sorta

####DEFER:
Organize this disaster of a readme
finally make a template for this sort of thing that maps to Things.app
make an importer for that, actually
Import readme to Things.app so I can keep track of it properly
Determine new milestones for tomorrow: defer to tomorrow

####VERDICT:
Very good, considering how I've been feeling lately. Set myself up pretty well for continued work on this tomorrow. Need to sleep on some decisions, and spin the wireframes and storyboards around in my head a bit, solidify the SwiftUI Layout I want for the content, as well as the HTML DOM structure I want for it, then figure out the initial transforms from DocC > DTO > SwiftUI Content/Detail | HTML DOM.

####Tomorrow:


- Determine tasks for today: TODO
- Organize this disaster of a readme, using actual markdown: TODO
- Import readme to Things.app so I can keep track of it properly: TODO
