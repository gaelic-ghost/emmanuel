	struct Detail {
		// Maybe use Outline/Detail Groups..? Hmmm... Context dependent, probably need to consider a few layouts... this may be left to later down the line once the other views are sorted out and I've though mroe about the semantic similarity modeling and how I wanna implement, store, and potentially host, that, or if i intend to bundle that... this would be easier if I didn't have to worry so mcuh about the even tiniest hosting costs, or going broke before I need to renew my dev license fee to Apple to even ship this once it's done...
