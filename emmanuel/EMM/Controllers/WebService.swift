 TODO: Maybe put an explainer here on the new webkit api and some of the more hidden functionality, since it's really cool but the nitty gritty stuff is done very differently from WKWebView/Page/etc.

 Maybe some explanation on DOM Scripting here...
 I should just build an automated system to do that for me. That wouldn't be that hard.
 TODO: put that on the todo list...
 
 TODO: Investigate WebKit API additions in OS 26.2, looks like 'Transferable' may save me some work and JS
 TODO: Look into swift-dom and the other neat Swift <-> Web kinda packages I stumbled across the other day...
